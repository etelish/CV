I am a highly motivated, ambitious and hardworking individual transitioning into my desired career path within the tech industry as a Software Developer.

After 4 years of working as a reservationist I desired more job satisfaction and was intrigued by the fact that being a developer allowed me to be not only a problem solver but also allowed me to express my creative side.

Since August I have undergone a  full time immersive coding bootcamp with Makers Academy and continue to build my experience and knowledge on programming languages.

I am eager for continual development within the Tech industry and also looking for new experiences and potential employment within the sector.


## Skills

- **Fast Learner**

Within a week I was able to learn the basics of JavaScript while at Makers. Through constant learning and building I have been able to accomplish building a Thermostat business model. For Makers Final group project with the basics of JavaScript me and my group completed our Project using the MERN(Mongodb, Express, React/Redux and Node) stack to build a website that allows users to post food they are giving away. Having not being taught these technologies during the course it is a testament of how fast I can adapt and learn new technologies.

- **Problem Solver**

I really enjoy problem solving and think I'm one of the few that see the beauty in it. I love being inquisitive and conducting investigations into what the core problem may be and then coming up with solutions to solve them.

For our Airbnb clone project we wanted to implement a functionality that allowed users to input the date they wanted to book but through a calendar. As we kept facing difficulties implementing this (would not display at all, if it did display it was in the wrong format) through experimenting with the Jquery date picker and extensive research I managed to have it fully displaying on our web page with the correct format.

- **Attention to detail**

I am someone who pays attention to detail thoroughly enjoy tasks that require accuracy. Working as a Reservationist for TFL, I constantly had to scan records of trip data to suit a precise criteria for customers bookings. This usually had to be done within a short space of time which also meant working under pressure.

In my role as a Customer service advisor at Santander I was required to process large international payments for clients. Dealing with large sums of money I had to ensure that it had been counted correctly and remain vigilant for fraudulent activity. This required me to remain focused and to check things multiple times just to minimise potential mistakes which could in turn cause a loss to the customers and company.

- **Team Player**

During my time at Makers, I was  very much someone that enjoyed being able to support and work alongside others. Ensuring every member in my team projects felt valued and also providing constructive feedback. The beauty of being in such a position is that it allows me to reinforce what i've learnt through teaching and reviewing code to others.

While at Makers i also took up the opportunity to mentor 2 students as i strongly believe in giving back. By doing so it gives the opportunity for me the opportunity to give guidance and advice for working collaboratively.
Im a strong believer in sharing knowledge and experience as it is  important, even if it's something that didn't go so well it still matters. Reflection and feedback are how we level up and grow as a team rather than individuals. Sharing is paramount to this.
