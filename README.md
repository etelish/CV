I am a highly motivated, ambitious and hardworking individual transitioning into my desired career path within the tech industry as a Software Developer.

After 4 years of working as a reservationist I desired more job satisfaction and was intrigued by the fact that being a developer allowed me to be not only a problem solver but also allowed me to express my creative side.

Since August I have undergone a  full time immersive coding bootcamp with Makers Academy and continue to build my experience and knowledge on programming languages.

I am eager for continual development within the Tech industry and also looking for new experiences and potential employment within the sector.
